# Phase 10 Enhancement: Order Manager Stuck Market SELL Orders

## Overview

This document describes the successful enhancement to Phase 10 (order_manager.py) that adds robust stuck market SELL order detection and cancellation functionality. This enhancement provides a crucial safety net for market SELL orders that may get stuck in rare scenarios.

## Problem Statement

The original order_manager.py script handled stale BUY orders and orphaned orders, but did not monitor for stuck market SELL orders. Market SELL orders can occasionally get stuck in active states (e.g., 'accepted', 'pending_new') for extended periods, preventing the DCA bot from continuing its take-profit attempts.

## Enhancement Details

### New Constants
- **`STUCK_MARKET_SELL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 75`**: Timeout threshold for identifying stuck market SELL orders

### New Functions

#### `identify_stuck_sell_orders(current_time: datetime) -> List[DcaCycle]`
- Queries database for cycles in 'selling' status with active orders
- Calculates order age using `latest_order_created_at` field
- Identifies orders older than 75 seconds as potentially stuck
- Returns list of DcaCycle objects with stuck SELL orders

#### `handle_stuck_sell_orders(client, stuck_cycles: List[DcaCycle]) -> int`
- Verifies order status on Alpaca using `get_order()` function
- Checks if order is in active state ('new', 'accepted', 'pending_new', 'partially_filled')
- Attempts cancellation only for orders still in active states
- Skips cancellation for orders already in terminal states ('filled', 'canceled', 'rejected', 'expired')
- Returns count of successfully canceled orders

### Enhanced Main Logic

The main function now includes:
1. **Step 8**: Stuck market SELL order identification and handling
2. **Enhanced Summary**: Includes stuck SELL order statistics
3. **Improved Flow**: Handles cases with no open orders but potential stuck SELL orders

### Key Features

#### Timezone-Aware Comparisons
- Uses timezone-aware datetime comparisons for `latest_order_created_at`
- Ensures accurate age calculations across different environments

#### Alpaca Status Verification
- Fetches current order status from Alpaca before attempting cancellation
- Prevents unnecessary cancellation attempts for already-processed orders
- Logs appropriate messages for different order states

#### Graceful Error Handling
- Handles cases where orders are not found on Alpaca
- Continues processing other stuck orders if individual orders fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Implementation Files

### Core Enhancement
- **`scripts/order_manager.py`**: Main enhancement with new functions and logic
- **`src/utils/alpaca_client_rest.py`**: Added `get_order()` function for order status verification

### Unit Tests
- **`tests/test_order_manager.py`**: Added 6 new unit tests covering:
  - `test_identify_stuck_sell_orders()`: Basic stuck order identification
  - `test_identify_stuck_sell_orders_empty_result()`: Empty database result handling
  - `test_identify_stuck_sell_orders_database_error()`: Database error handling
  - `test_handle_stuck_sell_orders_active_order()`: Active order cancellation
  - `test_handle_stuck_sell_orders_terminal_state()`: Terminal state handling
  - `test_handle_stuck_sell_orders_order_not_found()`: Missing order handling

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
- **Total Tests**: 216 (up from 210)
- **New Tests**: 6 for stuck SELL order functionality
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (all tests passing)

### Functional Testing
- Order manager script runs successfully with enhanced functionality
- Proper logging and summary reporting
- Handles both scenarios: with and without open orders
- Correctly identifies and processes stuck SELL orders

## Integration with Existing System

### TradingStream Integration
- Order manager only requests cancellation via Alpaca API
- TradingStream will react to canceled events and update database state
- Follows existing Phase 9 enhanced cancellation logic

### Database Consistency
- No direct database modifications by order manager
- Relies on TradingStream to handle state transitions
- Maintains separation of concerns between components

## Operational Benefits

### Safety Net
- Prevents market SELL orders from remaining stuck indefinitely
- Ensures DCA bot can continue take-profit attempts
- Reduces manual intervention requirements

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging for stuck order detection and handling
- Clear summary statistics in order manager output
- Integration with existing logging infrastructure

### Reliability
- Robust error handling prevents script failures
- Graceful degradation when Alpaca API is unavailable
- Maintains existing functionality while adding new capabilities

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- Uses existing `DRY_RUN` configuration for testing
- Respects existing `STALE_ORDER_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` for other order types
- No additional configuration required

### Deployment
- Drop-in enhancement to existing order_manager.py
- No database schema changes required
- Compatible with existing cron job configurations

## Summary

The Phase 10 enhancement successfully adds stuck market SELL order detection and cancellation to the order_manager.py script. This provides a crucial safety net for rare scenarios where market SELL orders get stuck, ensuring the DCA bot can continue operating effectively.

### Key Achievements:
- ✅ **75-second timeout** for stuck SELL order detection
- ✅ **Alpaca status verification** before cancellation attempts
- ✅ **Comprehensive unit tests** with 100% pass rate
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** and logging
- ✅ **Integration with existing TradingStream** cancellation logic
- ✅ **No breaking changes** to existing functionality

The enhancement maintains pragmatism by focusing on the specific problem of stuck market SELL orders while leveraging existing infrastructure and patterns established in previous phases.
