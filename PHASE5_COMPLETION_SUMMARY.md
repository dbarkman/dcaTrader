# Phase 5 Backtesting Engine - Completion Summary

## 🎯 Phase 5 Objective
Enhance the backtesting engine with caretaker logic simulation (cooldown management, stale order cancellation) and comprehensive performance reporting.

## ✅ Major Features Implemented

### 1. Cooldown Period Management
**Purpose**: Simulate the time-based cooldown period between completed cycles

**Key Features**:
- Automatic cooldown expiry checking on each bar
- Smooth transition from 'cooldown' to 'watching' status
- Complete cycle state reset for new trading opportunities
- Configurable cooldown periods (default 300 seconds/5 minutes)

**Methods**:
- `check_cooldown_expiry()` - Checks if cooldown period has expired
- `_reset_cycle_for_new_trade()` - Resets cycle state for fresh start

**Logic**:
- Compares current bar timestamp with `completed_at + cooldown_period`
- Automatically transitions status and resets cycle variables
- Maintains entry tracking for accurate performance metrics

### 2. Stale/Stuck Order Cancellation
**Purpose**: Simulate automatic cancellation of orders that remain open too long

**Key Features**:
- **Stale BUY Limit Orders**: Canceled after 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Stuck SELL Market Orders**: Canceled after 2 minutes (configurable)
- Automatic cancellation event generation
- Integration with existing cancellation handlers

**Configuration Constants**:
```python
STALE_ORDER_THRESHOLD_MINUTES = 5      # BUY limit orders
STUCK_MARKET_SELL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 120  # SELL market orders
```

**Methods**:
- `_check_stale_orders()` - Identifies orders to cancel based on age
- `process_cancellation_event()` - Handles order cancellation events
- Integrated into `process_bar_fills()` for automatic processing

**Cancellation Logic**:
- Age calculation based on bar timestamps
- Status updates to 'canceled' with reason tracking
- Cycle state reversion to allow strategy retry
- Comprehensive logging for performance analysis

### 3. Comprehensive Performance Reporting
**Purpose**: Calculate and display detailed backtesting performance metrics

**New Data Structures**:
```python
@dataclass
class CompletedTrade:
    asset_symbol: str
    entry_timestamp: datetime
    exit_timestamp: datetime
    entry_price: Decimal
    exit_price: Decimal
    quantity: Decimal
    realized_pnl: Decimal
    trade_type: str
    safety_orders_used: int

@dataclass
class PerformanceMetrics:
    total_realized_pnl: Decimal
    total_unrealized_pnl: Decimal
    total_trades: int
    winning_trades: int
    losing_trades: int
    win_rate: Decimal
    average_pnl_per_trade: Decimal
    max_drawdown: Decimal
    total_fees_paid: Decimal
    final_portfolio_value: Decimal
```

**Performance Calculations**:
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Average P/L**: Mean profit/loss per completed trade
- **Total Return**: Combined realized and unrealized P/L
- **Return Percentage**: Performance relative to starting capital
- **Trade Analysis**: Breakdown of winning vs losing trades

**Reporting Features**:
- Detailed portfolio performance summary
- Trading statistics with win/loss breakdown
- Performance assessment with qualitative feedback
- Asset and strategy configuration display
- Comprehensive logging throughout backtest

### 4. Enhanced Portfolio Management
**Purpose**: Track detailed performance metrics and completed trades

**New Features**:
- **Trade Recording**: Automatic tracking of completed cycles
- **Performance Tracking**: Realized/unrealized P/L separation
- **Fee Accounting**: Comprehensive transaction cost tracking
- **Portfolio Valuation**: Current market value calculation

**Methods**:
- `record_completed_trade()` - Records finished trading cycles
- `get_unrealized_pnl()` - Calculates mark-to-market P/L
- `get_portfolio_value()` - Total portfolio valuation
- Enhanced logging with position details

### 5. Integration with Existing Systems
**Purpose**: Seamless operation with Phase 1-4 infrastructure

**Integration Points**:
- **Historical Data**: Uses Phase 1 data infrastructure
- **Strategy Logic**: Compatible with Phase 2 refactored strategies
- **Core Loop**: Enhances Phase 3 main loop architecture
- **Broker Simulation**: Extends Phase 4 order simulation

**Enhanced Main Loop**:
```python
# Phase 5 enhancements in main loop:
1. Check cooldown expiry before strategy decisions
2. Process fills AND cancellations from broker
3. Calculate comprehensive performance metrics
4. Display detailed performance report
```

## 📊 Testing Results

### Unit Test Coverage
**Total Tests**: 34 tests across 2 test suites
- **Phase 4 Tests**: 20 tests (broker simulator and portfolio)
- **Phase 5 Tests**: 14 tests (cooldown, cancellation, performance)

**Test Categories**:

#### TestCooldownManagement (5 tests)
- ✅ Cooldown expiry timing (before/after/exact)
- ✅ Cycle state reset on expiry
- ✅ No-op when not in cooldown status

#### TestStaleOrderCancellation (4 tests)
- ✅ BUY limit order cancellation after threshold
- ✅ SELL market order cancellation after timeout
- ✅ No cancellation before threshold
- ✅ Multiple order types cancellation logic

#### TestPerformanceReporting (3 tests)

- ✅ Edge case handling (no trades)
- ✅ Win rate calculation accuracy

#### TestCancellationEventProcessing (2 tests)
- ✅ Cancellation event processing and cycle updates
- ✅ Non-current order cancellation handling

**All 34 tests passing successfully! ✅**
